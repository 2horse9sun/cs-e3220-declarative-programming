# Here is a dummy Kripke model, with five worlds, all atomic propositions
# false in all worlds, and no accessible worlds for any world.

 w0 {a,b,c } w1, w3, w4;
 w1 {b,c } w0;
 w2 {c } ;
 w3 {c } w2, w4;
 w4 {c } w1;

# Your task is to extend the model so that all of the following formulas
# are true in the Kripke model.

a and b;

POSS (not a and b);

POSS not b;

POSS NECE (a and b);

POSS NECE (not a);

NECE NECE c;
